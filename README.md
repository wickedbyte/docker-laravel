# PHP-FPM Docker Image for Laravel

*A docker image tailored for development with Laravel (>= 7)*

Based on the official `php:7.4-fpm` image, this image includes the required PHP
extensions for Laravel; a couple extra suggested PHP extensions like `redis`;
`xdebug` and `ext-gmp`; NPM; Composer; some handy global composer extensions and
packages; and bash aliases.
